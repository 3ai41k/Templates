**Adding Xcode Templates**

First of all, you should create specific folder here:

**~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/**

You can use Finder to reach the folder above but you will see that it does not exists. You must create it using Finder.

**~/Library/Developer/Xcode**

Once created you can add your specific container that I will name: "ProjectName_Templates". Then, you must move a subfolders from this repository yo your container.
